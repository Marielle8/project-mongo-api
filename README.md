# Mongo API Project

This project was about seed and fetch data from a Mongo database by using Mongoose model.

## The problem

I created this project by coding along with Technigo bootcamps recorded lectures on how to work with data in Mongo using Mongoose. I had some erros in my terminal when I first started the project but got help with that after I asked about it in a help channel in Slack. I ended up with one error message at one of my endpoints but I tried to do them on all the endpoints from the beginning. When it didn't work I just went with the working one and deleted the rest of them. If I had more time I would have tried harder to get the error messages to work and also made som more endpoints just to practice that.
